# Task Description
Create a Raycast extension for converting between Chinese lunar dates and solar dates. The extension should support bidirectional conversion with a user-friendly interface.

# Project Overview
A Raycast extension template has been established with the following structure:
- Extension name: "lunar-date"
- Command name: "lunar" 
- Mode: "no-view" (currently configured)
- Author: joe_mi990416
- Basic TypeScript and Node.js setup with Raycast API dependencies

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)

## Current Project Structure
The project is a standard Raycast extension template with:
- `package.json` configured for a "lunar-date" extension
- Empty `src/lunar.ts` file (0 lines)
- Standard Raycast dependencies (@raycast/api v1.99.4, @raycast/utils v1.17.0)
- TypeScript configuration and development tools
- Extension icon in assets directory

## Key Requirements Analysis
Based on user request and Raycast documentation:
1. Convert Chinese lunar dates to solar dates
2. Convert solar dates to Chinese lunar dates  
3. Bidirectional conversion functionality
4. User-friendly interface suitable for Raycast

## Technical Constraints
- Current command mode is "no-view" which limits UI capabilities
- Need to determine optimal interaction pattern for date input/output
- Must comply with Raycast extension standards and API patterns

## Available Libraries Research
From web search results, several strong candidates for lunar calendar conversion:
1. **lunar-typescript** (114,282 weekly downloads) - Comprehensive lunar calendar library by 6tail, supports extensive Chinese calendar features
2. **date-chinese** (203,748 weekly downloads) - Well-maintained TypeScript library with built-in types
3. **js-calendar-converter** (749 weekly downloads) - Recent updates (2 months ago), GPL licensed
4. **chinese-lunar-calendar** (1,077 weekly downloads) - Simpler library focused on basic conversion
5. **@shuimo-design/lunar** - Modern TypeScript implementation with good documentation

## Raycast API Considerations
- Need to decide between different command modes (no-view, view, menu-bar)
- Consider using Form components for date input
- Toast notifications for quick results
- Clipboard integration for easy copying
- Error handling for invalid dates

# Proposed Solution (Populated by INNOVATE mode)

## Solution Architecture Options

### Option 1: Form-Based Interactive UI
**Approach**: Change command mode to "view" and implement a form-based interface
**Pros**:
- User-friendly date input with dropdowns/text fields
- Clear visual feedback and results display
- Can show both conversion directions simultaneously
- Supports validation and error handling
- Familiar Raycast UI patterns

**Cons**:
- Requires more user interaction steps
- Slightly slower for quick conversions
- More complex implementation

### Option 2: Argument-Based Quick Conversion
**Approach**: Keep "no-view" mode and use command arguments for date input
**Pros**:
- Extremely fast for power users
- Single command execution
- Minimal UI overhead
- Good for automation/scripting

**Cons**:
- Less discoverable for new users
- Requires memorizing argument format
- Limited error feedback
- Harder to implement bidirectional detection

### Option 3: Hybrid Clipboard + Form Approach
**Approach**: Intelligent clipboard detection with fallback to form UI
**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds - auto-detection when possible
- Seamless workflow integration
- Graceful fallback for manual input
- Smart date format detection

**Cons**:
- More complex logic implementation
- Potential privacy concerns with clipboard access
- May have false positives in date detection

## Library Selection Analysis

### Recommended: lunar-typescript
**Rationale**: 
- Highest download count indicating community trust
- Comprehensive feature set beyond basic conversion
- TypeScript support with proper typing
- Active maintenance (updated 1 month ago)
- Supports extensive Chinese calendar features (festivals, zodiac, etc.)

**Alternative: date-chinese**
- Excellent TypeScript support with built-in declarations
- Well-documented API
- Focused specifically on calendar conversion
- Good performance with caching

## Proposed Feature Set

### Core Features:
1. **Solar to Lunar Conversion**: Convert Gregorian dates to Chinese lunar calendar
2. **Lunar to Solar Conversion**: Convert lunar dates to Gregorian calendar
3. **Smart Date Detection**: Automatically detect input format and conversion direction
4. **Result Display**: Show converted date with additional context (zodiac, festivals)

### Enhanced Features:
1. **Multiple Input Formats**: Support various date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY, etc.)
2. **Clipboard Integration**: Auto-paste results to clipboard
3. **Historical Range**: Support wide date range (1900-2100)
4. **Cultural Information**: Include zodiac animals, traditional festivals, and solar terms
5. **Today's Date**: Quick access to current date in both calendars

## User Experience Flow

### Primary Workflow:
1. User invokes "lunar" command
2. Form appears with date input field and conversion direction toggle
3. User enters date (with format auto-detection)
4. Results display immediately with copy-to-clipboard option
5. Additional cultural information shown as secondary details

### Quick Workflow (Advanced):
1. User selects date text and copies to clipboard
2. Invokes "lunar" command 
3. Extension auto-detects clipboard content and shows conversion
4. Results automatically copied back to clipboard
